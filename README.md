# Ultrasound bone image segmentation using U-Net in MATLAB

This project is my Master's thesis work where automated image segmentation was performed on both simulated and real Ultrasound images of
bone surfaces using a specific convolutional neural network called a "U-net". 

This thesis introduces the concept of training the deep learning methods with large-scale simulated bone ultrasound data and investigating
how using large-scale simulated data along with limited real ultrasound data affects the segmentation performance of the deep learning network.

The project utilized different methods such as data augmentation and transfer learning to approach the problem statement and provided 
a strong introduction to machine learning.
